Hello, I think this file will be more like an excuse file than an explanation one :)

I really want to try my best to show-off my years experience, but I think I have to admit that I'm so lacking on building a new react-app from scratch. It's been a while since I build react-app from scratch.

I try to use vite than create-react-app, since it's more light and cra will take more moment to install and code-bloating
I try to implement my app using React Hooks, but I think I still got more to go.
I've been using ant-design for my apps, but now I'm using Bootstrap, for the same reason, I think it'll be lighter.

I learned a lot from this assignment test, I'll take the result whatever it turns out to be :)
Thank you :)
